# Machine Learning (ML) Coursera Summary

1. What is Machine Learning
1. Linear Algebra Review
1. Linear Regression with One Variable

## What is Machine Learning?
Arthur Samuel (1959)
: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchel (1998)
: Well-posed Learning Problem: a computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, it its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.


## Different Kinds of Learning

### Supervised Learning
What?

1. "Right answers" given
1. Predict regression or classification


Why?

1. To make predictions regarding a classification for new examples such as items, pictures, medical status, ect
1. To make predictions of prices or likelyhood of projected profit given circumstances, ect

When?

1. You have data that you know the answer to and train that data to reflect accurately on the data set and make accurate predictions regarding outside data

### Unsupervised Learning

What?

1. "No answers" given
1. Want to classify or predict data but not give tell your model how to do so explicitly

Why?

1. Want to catagorize individuals and pull new and interesting information from large non-human readable data sets
1. Give order to chaos

When?

1. Cocktail party problem
1. Astronomical data analysis
1. Social network analysis


### Reinforcement learning, recommender systems

What?

1. How intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward

Why?

1. Reward and Punishment learning
1. Self learning
1. 

When?

1.



## Linear Algebra Review

Matrix
: Rectangular array of numbers rows x columns (n x m)

Matrix Elements
: Aij = "i,j entry" ith row, jth column

Vector
: nx1 Matrix (yi = ith element)

Matrix Addition / Subtraction
: must have same shape, add each index ij with cooresponding index ij from other

Scalar Multiplication:
num x matrix[][], multiply each item by number

If multiple back to back -> order of operations

Matrix-vector Multiplication
: (m x n) X (n x z) (n must be the same to do operation with resulting m x z sized matrix)


## Matrix Properties

A x B != B x A
: not commutative

(A x B) x C == A x (B x C)

Identity Matrix
: Denoted I or Inxn

A * I = I * A = A

AB != BA

Inverse
: 

Traspose
:
